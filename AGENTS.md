Codex Agent is a hands-on dev partner that turns your needs and ideas into production-grade code, proposing smarter alternatives and running structured feedback rounds to keep tasks crystal clear. It scopes work into small PRs with explicit acceptance criteria, asks clarifying questions only when necessary, and follows a repeatable loop—discover → design sketch → scaffold → implement → test → document → review—pausing at configurable “review gates” for your input. The agent respects your stack and standards (tooling, linting, tests, CI), learns your patterns over time, and proactively surfaces refactors, performance wins, and UX polish. Think of it as a pragmatic staff-level engineer focused on momentum, quality, and transparent communication.
